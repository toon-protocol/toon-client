# TASK

Review the code changes on branch `{{BRANCH}}` and improve code clarity, consistency, and maintainability while preserving exact functionality.

# CONTEXT

## Branch diff

!`git diff {{TARGET_BRANCH}}...{{BRANCH}}`

## Commits on this branch

!`git log {{TARGET_BRANCH}}..{{BRANCH}} --oneline`

# REVIEW PROCESS

1. **Understand the change**: Read the diff and commits above to understand the intent.

2. **Analyze for improvements**: Look for opportunities to:
   - Reduce unnecessary complexity and nesting
   - Eliminate redundant code and abstractions
   - Improve readability through clear variable and function names
   - Consolidate related logic
   - Remove unnecessary comments that describe obvious code
   - Avoid nested ternary operators - prefer switch statements or if/else chains
   - Choose clarity over brevity - explicit code is often better than overly compact code

3. **Check correctness**:
   - Does the implementation match the intent? Are edge cases handled?
   - Are new/changed behaviours covered by tests?
   - Are there unsafe casts, `any` types, or unchecked assumptions?
   - Does the change introduce injection vulnerabilities, credential leaks, or other security issues?

4. **Maintain balance**: Avoid over-simplification that could:
   - Reduce code clarity or maintainability
   - Create overly clever solutions that are hard to understand
   - Combine too many concerns into single functions or components
   - Remove helpful abstractions that improve code organization
   - Make the code harder to debug or extend

5. **Apply project standards**: Follow the coding standards defined in @.sandcastle/CODING_STANDARDS.md

6. **Preserve functionality**: Never change what the code does - only how it does it. All original features, outputs, and behaviors must remain intact.

# EXECUTION

If you find improvements to make:

1. Make the changes directly on this branch
2. Run toon-client's gate to ensure nothing is broken — in order: `eslint .`, then `pnpm -r run build`, then `pnpm run typecheck`, then `vitest run` (build must precede typecheck so cross-package `dist/*.d.ts` exist). `typecheck` is a SOFT gate with ~82 known pre-existing errors (#423) — just don't ADD new ones; `lint`, `build`, and `test` must be green. If you touched a publishable package (`client`, `client-mcp`, `views`, `rig`, `arweave`), add a changeset (`pnpm changeset`).
3. Commit describing the refinements

If the code is already clean and well-structured, do nothing.

Once complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.

## Context budget
If you approach ~60% of your context window, STOP: write a structured handoff note (current state + remaining steps) to `.sandcastle/logs/handoff-<task-id>.md` and end your turn so a fresh agent continues. Do not push past ~60% — small, resumable units beat one degraded run.
