# No-op merge guard: a PR whose merge result changes zero files must not merge green.
# Brought in-house from toon-meta's empty-pr-guard.yml (toon-client#706). Run by the
# `no-op-merge` job in ci.yml on the checked-out refs/pull/N/merge. Inputs, all from the
# pull_request event: PR_HEAD_SHA, PR_BASE_REF, PR_NUMBER, PR_CHANGED_FILES (the three-dot
# count; not recomputed here, since a shallow clone has no merge base).
# Origin: connector#1008 merged green with an empty squash commit.
