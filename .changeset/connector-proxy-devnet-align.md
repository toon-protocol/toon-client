Route paid writes through the connector proxy (ILP-over-HTTP) and add devnet config + faucet helper.

`@toon-protocol/client`:

- **Transport-agnostic paid-write path.** `publishEvent`, `sendSwapPacket`, and `sendPayment` now route the ILP PREPARE + signed payment-channel claim through the ACTIVE ILP transport instead of hard-requiring a BTP socket. Selection mirrors `modes/http.ts`: the `runtimeClient` (the `HttpIlpClient` `POST /ilp` proxy transport when a `proxyUrl`/`connectorHttpEndpoint` is configured, else the BTP socket) is used when it implements `sendIlpPacketWithClaim`, with the BTP client as fallback. The old `NO_BTP_CLIENT` throw is replaced by a clearer `NO_ILP_TRANSPORT` error when no claim-capable transport is configured. BTP remains fully supported when it is the configured transport. All claim signing/construction is unchanged (claim validation stays connector-only).
- **New config fields** `proxyUrl` and `faucetUrl` on `ToonClientConfig`. Setting `proxyUrl` (e.g. `https://proxy.devnet.toonprotocol.dev`) derives `connectorHttpEndpoint` (`…/ilp`) so writes route over ILP-over-HTTP, satisfies the `connectorUrl` requirement, and suppresses BTP-url auto-derivation (the proxy edge serves ILP-over-HTTP, not necessarily BTP). New `proxyIlpEndpoint()` helper.
- **New `fundWallet(faucetUrl, address, chain)` faucet helper** (`faucet.ts`). EVM is implemented (`POST /api/request`, drips ETH + USDC); Solana/Mina throw a clear "deferred (WS3)" error.

`@toon-protocol/client-mcp`:

- Daemon config accepts `proxyUrl`/`faucetUrl` (env `TOON_CLIENT_PROXY_URL` / `TOON_CLIENT_FAUCET_URL`) and `TOON_CLIENT_DESTINATION`. A `proxyUrl` now satisfies the uplink requirement (`btpUrl` becomes optional) so the daemon can write through the proxy with no BTP socket. The destination stays configurable (e.g. `g.proxy` for devnet) and is NOT hardcoded as a global default.
- Added `e2e/devnet.ts`: deployed-devnet endpoint constants + a `TOON_DEVNET_E2E`-gated `fundDevnetWallet()` step that funds the client wallet via the faucet helper before publishing. The normal unit suite never touches the network.

The eventual home for the devnet endpoints is a `@toon-protocol/core` devnet preset (upstream npm release); they live here as explicit config until that ships.
