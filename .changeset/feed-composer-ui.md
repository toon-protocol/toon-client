Polished social feed + composer UI. NoteCard is now a real feed item — identity avatar (profile picture, else a deterministic gradient fallback with npub initials), display name (joined from kind:0 profile binds, else MonoId npub), a relative timestamp, the note body, inline media, and an engagement footer (Reply + React with live reaction counts) wired to the existing `reply`/`react` actions. The composer and pay-confirm atoms get a card surface with an auto-sizing textarea and a footer toolbar that surfaces a UTF-8 byte counter (TOON fees scale with encoded bytes); the pay-to-write flow keeps its idle→confirm→publishing→receipt phases, now restyled so the confirm step clearly shows fee + settlement chain + size and the receipt reads as a success state. Built on the existing shadcn/OKLCH tokens and lucide-react — no new deps; the atom contract, registered kinds, and inline-media rendering are unchanged. (client-mcp serves the refreshed app bundle.)
